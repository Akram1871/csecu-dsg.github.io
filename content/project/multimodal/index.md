title: "Multimodal and Multitask NLP"
summary: "Multimodal NLP research explores the integration of information from multiple sources, such as text, images, and audio, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of language and communication. By combining modalities, this field aims to enhance natural language processing applications, enabling machines to interpret and generate content in a more contextually aware and human-like manner."

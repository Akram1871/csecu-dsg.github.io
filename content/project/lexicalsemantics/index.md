title: "Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP)"
summary: "
Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) is a burgeoning field in NLP that aims to quantify and assess the complexity of vocabulary and language structure in texts. Researchers in LCP are developing models and methodologies to automatically predict the lexical complexity of written content, providing valuable insights into language difficulty and aiding in applications such as language education and content accessibility assessment."

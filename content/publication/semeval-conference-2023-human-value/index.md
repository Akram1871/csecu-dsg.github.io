abstract: "Human values identification from a set of argument is becoming a prominent area of research in argument mining. Among some options, values convey what may be the most desirable and widely accepted answer. The diversity of human beliefs, random texture and implicit meaning within the arguments makes it more difficult to identify human values from the arguments. To address these challenges, SemEval-2023 Task 4 introduced a shared task ValueEval focusing on identifying human values categories based on given arguments. This paper presents our participation in this task where we propose a finetuned DeBERTa transformers-based classification approach to identify the desire human value category. We utilize different training strategy with the finetuned DeBERTa model to enhance contextual representation on this downstream task. Our proposed method achieved competitive performance among the participantsâ€™ methods."

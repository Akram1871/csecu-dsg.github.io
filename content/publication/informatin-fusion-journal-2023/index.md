abstract: "Desire is a set of human aspirations and wishes that comprise verbal and cognitive aspects that drive human feelings and behaviors, distinguishing humans from other animals. Understanding human desire has the potential to be one of the most fascinating and challenging research domains. It is tightly coupled with sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. It is beneficial for increasing human-computer interactions, recognizing human emotional intelligence, understanding interpersonal relationships, and making decisions. However, understanding human desire is challenging and under-explored because ways of eliciting desire might be different among humans. The task gets more difficult due to the diverse cultures, countries, and languages. Prior studies overlooked the use of image-text pairwise feature representation, which is crucial for the task of human desire understanding. In this research, we have proposed a unified multimodal transformer-based framework with image-text pair settings to identify human desire, sentiment, and emotion. The core of our proposed method lies in the encoder module, which is built using two state-of-the-art multimodal transformer models. These models allow us to extract diverse features. To effectively extract visual and contextualized embedding features from social media image and text pairs, we conducted joint fine-tuning of two pre-trained multimodal transformer models: Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and Vision-and-Augmented-Language Transformer (VAuLT). Subsequently, we use an early fusion strategy on these embedding features to obtain combined diverse feature representations of the image-text pair. This consolidation incorporates diverse information about this task, enabling us to robustly perceive the context and image pair from multiple perspectives. Moreover, we leverage a multi-sample dropout mechanism to enhance the generalization ability and expedite the training process of our proposed method. To evaluate our proposed approach, we used the multimodal dataset MSED for the human desire understanding task. Through our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our method excels in capturing both visual and contextual information, resulting in superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches by 3% for sentiment analysis, 2.2% for emotion analysis, and approximately 1% for desire analysis."

    abstract = "Automated processing of legal documents is essential to manage the enormous volume of legal corpus and to make it easily accessible to a broad spectrum of people. But due to the amorphous and variable nature of legal documents, it is very challenging to directly proceed with complicated processes such as summarization, analysis, and query. Segmenting the documents as per the rhetorical roles can aid and accelerate such procedures. This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2023 task 6: Sub-task A: Rhetorical Roles Prediction. We utilize a finetuned Legal-BERT to address this task. We also conduct an error analysis to illustrate the shortcomings of our deployed approach.",

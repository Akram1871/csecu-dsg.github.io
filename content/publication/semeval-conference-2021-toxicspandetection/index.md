# **[On review]**
abstract: "The upsurge of prolific blogging and microblogging platforms enabled the abusers to spread negativity and threats greater than ever. Detecting the toxic portions substantially aids to moderate or exclude the abusive parts for maintaining sound online platforms. This paper describes our participation in the SemEval 2021 toxic span detection task. The task requires detecting spans that convey toxic remarks from the given text. We explore an ensemble of sequence labeling models including the BiLSTM-CRF, spaCy NER model with custom toxic tags, and fine-tuned BERT model to identify the toxic spans. Finally, a majority voting ensemble method is used to determine the unified toxic spans. Experimental results depict the competitive performance of our model among the participants."

abstract: "Recognizing complex and ambiguous named entities (NEs) is one of the formidable tasks in the NLP domain. However, the diversity of linguistic constituents, syntactic structure, semantic ambiguity as well as differences from traditional NEs make it challenging to identify the complex NEs. To address these challenges, SemEval-2022 Task 11 introduced a shared task MultiCoNER focusing on complex named entity recognition in multilingual settings. This paper presents our participation in this task where we propose two different approaches including a BiLSTM-CRF model with stacked-embedding strategy and a transformer-based approach. Our proposed method achieved competitive performance among the participantsâ€™ methods in a few languages."
